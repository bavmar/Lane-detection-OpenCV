# Lane-detection-OpenCV
This is the repository for the code associated with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIBYzkAr4so) video.



## Information
The application detects lanes using a ROI, Multiple color thresholds and Edges detection.
The reason i didn't put in the code for the sign detection is because It's not really optimized yet. Maybe i will post it in the future.

## Versions
OpenCV: 3.4.3

Numpy: 1.15.4

Python 3.7
